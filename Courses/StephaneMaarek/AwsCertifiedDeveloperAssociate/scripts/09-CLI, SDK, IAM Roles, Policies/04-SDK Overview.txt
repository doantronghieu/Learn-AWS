So now let's talk about the AWS SDK overview.

So what is SDK?

Well, what if you wanted to perform actions on AWS

directly from your applications code

without using the CLI that we've been using so far?

For this, we use an SDK which is a software development kit

and there are a bunch of official SDKs for AWS

in different languages,

for example Java, .NET, Node.js,

PHP, Python, Go, Ruby, and C++, okay?

And maybe the list will get longer over time.

So we've been using the Python SDK when we are using the CLI

because the CLI is actually written in Python

and it uses the Boto3 SDK.

Okay, so we use the SDK when we issue API calls

against AWS services, for example DynamoDB or Amazon S3.

And as I said, fun fact, the CLI uses the Python SDK Boto3.

So the exam expects you to know when you should use an SDK.

So we'll see the SDK

when we get to the Lambda functions in this course

and we'll see how the SDK works in practice with code.

So in the meantime, we're good to go.

So good to know, if you don't specify a region

and you don't configure a default region,

then the us-east-1 will be chosen by default

by your SDK to issue API calls

and that is something the exam can test you on as well

on the developer exam, okay?

So that's it for the SDK at a high level.

Don't worry, we'll get some practice with it,

but it's good to get an introduction

and I will see you in the next lecture.
