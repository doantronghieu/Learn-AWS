So, now let's talk about S3 Select

and Glacier Select.

The idea is that you know that you want to retrieve

a file from S3,

but then you're going to filter it after retrieving it,

and therefore you're retrieving too much data.

What if instead you could use SQL

to perform server-side filtering?

Therefore, that means that you're going to filter

by rows or by columns using simple SQL statements

to have less network transfers

and less CPU cost client-side

to actually go through the data and filter it.

So before S3 Select,

what you do is that you retrieve all the data

and then, application-side, you're going to filter it

to find what you need.

And that's a lot of data coming in

for only a little bit of data being used.

But if you use S3 Select,

you actually have Amazon S3 filter the file for you,

and you only retrieve the data you need.

Therefore, Amazon claims it's up to 400% faster

and 80% cheaper to use S3 Select.

Put it in another diagram,

we're going to want to get a CSV

with Amazon S3 Select, okay.

Amazon S3 is going to find the CSV file

and filter it server-side, so on its own service,

and then it will send us the filtered data sets

so that it's much smaller and much cheaper.

So for simple filtering, think about S3 Select

and that also works on Glacier, so Glacier Select.

That's it. I will see you in the next lecture.
