So now let's talk about how Amazon S3

can be used to create aesthetic websites.

So S3 can host static websites

and have them accessible on the internet

and the website URL will be depending

on the AWS region where you create this,

either this or that.

And they look very, very similar as you can tell.

But the only difference is that here, you have a dash

and here, you have a dot.

It doesn't really matter for you to remember this

but just so you know, here it is.

So we have an extra bucket

and it will contain files, maybe HTML files, maybe images

and then we're going to enable this to be compatible

with hosting a website.

So this is what it will look like with the corresponding URL

and then the user will access our S3 buckets.

But this will not work

if we don't have public reads enabled on our S3 buckets.

And this is why in the first place,

in the last lecture we learned about S3 bucket policies.

So if you have a 403 forbidden error

after enabling your S3 bucket for reads,

then that means that your bucket is not public.

Therefore, you must attach an S3 bucket policy

that allows it to be public.

So that's it for this short lecture,

now let's go into the hands on to practice this.

Okay, so let's enable our bucket

to be a website.

But first, I'm going to upload one more file here,

I'm going to upload my beach.jpg file into our buckets.

Okay, this is done, so we have two files into our buckets,

and let's go into Properties, scroll down,

and all the way down

you will find the static website hosting.

So click on Edit,

and here we will enable static website hosting.

We want to host a static website

and we need to specify an index document.

So I will say, index.html

and we will have to upload that file.

This is the default or homepage of the websites.

As you can see here, we also have a little warning sign

saying, hey, by the way

if you want to enable this as a website endpoint

you must make all your content publicly readable.

And we've done this in the previous lecture, so that's good.

Okay, so let's go and save this.

So this is saved, and go back into our objects.

And the one thing that's missing here

is that index, that HTML file.

So let's go to upload this,

we Add files and then I will click on index.html

and then upload, close it.

It's created, so now back into Properties,

let's scroll all the way down,

and you see now that's under static website hosting,

we have a bucket website endpoint.

So I copy this URL, paste it,

and I get, I love coffee.

Hello world!

And my coffee.jpg file.

So this working, so this is my index at HTML file,

and if I right click on this and open this image in new tab,

we have the public URL of our coffee.jpg.

So this is working,

and by the way if you wanted to change the coffee for beach,

well under beach.jpg we can see as well

this beach image right here.

So that means that everything is working,

our S3 bucket is enabled for static website hosting,

and thanks to the S3 bucket policy being public,

we can see all these files.

So we're good to go, I hope you like this lecture

and I will see you in the next lecture.
