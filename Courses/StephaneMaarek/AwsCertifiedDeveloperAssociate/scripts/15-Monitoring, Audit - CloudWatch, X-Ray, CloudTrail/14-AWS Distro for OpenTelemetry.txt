So now let's talk about AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry.

So OpenTelemetry is a project

and AWS has created a distribution of that project

that is AWS supported

and they call it Secure and Production Ready.

So what is OpenTelemetry?

Well, OpenTelemetry is a way

to get a single set of APIs,

library, agents

and collector services

to collect distributed traces

and metrics for your applications.

It can also help you collect metadata

from your AWS resources and services.

The idea is that it's very similar to X-Ray,

but it's open-source.

And so you have agents

and these agents can be auto-instrumented

to collect traces

without you even changing your code

which looks very similar to X-Ray.

And on top of it,

thanks to this collection

that can happen at scale

within your account and your applications.

All these traces and these metrics

can be sent to multiple AWS services

as well as partner solutions.

So for example,

we have traces that can be sent into the X-Ray service.

We have metrics that can be sent into CloudWatch

or traces and metrics

that can be sent into Prometheus.

The idea is that

you're going to instrument your applications

that are running on AWS,

for example on EC2,

on ECS,

on EKS,

Fargate or Lambda

or it could be applications

that are running on-premises.

You're going to then use the OpenTelemetry standard

to send these traces and metrics

to either AWS such as X-Ray

or partner services

such as Datadog and so on.

And so the difference

between OpenTelemetry and X-Ray is that

you may want to migrate

from X-Ray to using the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry.

If you want to standardize

with open source APIs

because you want everything to be using Telemetry.

Or you may want to send the traces data

to multiple destinations simultaneously

which is something that OpenTelemetry supports.

So to summarize,

we have the Distro for OpenTelemetry

where we collect traces

and then the request from each app gets passed through.

Then we can collect metrics again

for each map that has it.

And then we can also collect,

thanks to the AWS Distro,

we can collect contextual data

about your AWS resources.

And this can be sent to X-Ray,

CloudWatch,

Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus,

as well as any partner monitoring solutions

that is supported by OpenTelemetry.

So that's it.

Just a high level overview,

but you know what it is.

If you see this at the exam,

usually it's only,

it can only be one very high level question.

So I hope you liked it

and I will see you in the next lecture.
