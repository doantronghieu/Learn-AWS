We are nearing the end of the section,

but first let's talk about the kind of security tools

we have in IAM.

So we can create an IAM Credentials Report

and this is at your account-level.

This report will contain all your accounts users

and the status of their various credentials.

We'll be actually generating it right now

and having a look at it.

The second security tool we're gonna use in IAM

is called IAM Access Advisor.

This one is at the user-level

and the Access Advisor is going to show

the service permissions granted to a user

and when those services were last accessed.

This will be very helpful because we are talking already

about the principle of least privilege,

and so using this tool, we're able to see which permissions

are not used and reduce the permission a user can get

to be inline with the principle of least privilege.

So I will see you in the next lecture

to show you how to use the security tools.

So let's generate a credentials report.

For this, on the left hand side,

I just click on Credential report

and then Download credential report

which is going to create a CSV file.

Now this CSV, because I'm using a training account,

is not fascinating,

but as we can see we have two rows in it.

We have my root account and my account name, stephane.

We can see when the user was created,

if the password was enabled,

when the password was last used and last changed,

when is the next rotation to be expected

if we do enable password rotation?

Is MFA active?

So we can see it's active from my root accounts

but it is not active for my Stefane accounts.

Then access keys, are they generated or not?

Yes, they're created for my Stefane account,

but not for my root account,

and when they were last rotated, last used and so on,

you can get more information about other access keys

and certificates and so on.

So this report is extremely helpful

if you want to look at some users

that haven't been changing the password,

or using it, or their account,

it could be giving you a great way to find which users

that deserve your attention from a security standpoint.

Now let's have a look at IAM Access Advisor.

For this, I'm gonna go to my user, stephane,

and then on the right hand side, I click on Access Advisor.

And Access Advisor is going to show me

which services were accessed by my user and when.

So as you can see, organizations, health,

identity and access managers with IAM Service,

EC2, Resource Explorer, were all accessed by my user.

So I use my user to access these things

by clicking in the UI, but some services were not accessed,

for example, Alexa for Business

or AWS App2Container and so on.

So using Access and Advisor, you can actually have a look

at whether or not the user has the correct permissions.

And it turns out that maybe based on this access,

have 37 pages of this,

maybe the user needs access only to a few services

but not all of them.

And this UI allows you to drill down.

On top of it, if a user accesses a specific service

for example Amazon EC2, we are told

that this is the administrator access

that granted access to this service.

So to summarize, Access Advisor becomes very helpful

when you need to do granular user access permissions on AWS.

So that's it for this lecture.

I hope you liked it and I will see you in the next lecture.
