So now let's talk about

CloudFormation StackSets.

So the idea is that you want to create, update,

or delete stacks across multiple accounts and regions,

all within a single operation or template.

So from an administrative account, you will take a template

and you will create a StackSet out of it.

And this StackSet will allow you to deploy your stack

across multiple accounts in multiple regions,

and that's why it's called a StackSet.

So when you update a StackSet,

all the stack instances that are in all the target accounts

and in all the target regions are also going to be updated,

so it's really all at once.

Now, you can apply this to accounts you want,

but also one of the most common use cases

is actually to apply this to all accounts

within an AWS Organization,

which is a group of accounts in AWS.

And within an organization, only an administrator account

or someone who's been designated as an administrator

can create StackSets, of course.

Otherwise it would be chaos and security risks, okay?

So that's it, you just need to know the StackSet concept

at a high level.

So that's it.

I hope you liked it and I will see you in the next lecture.
