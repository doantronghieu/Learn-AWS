Now, here is a quick lecture

around RDS and Aurora Security.

So you can encrypt the data at-rest

on your RDS and Aurora database.

That means that the data is encrypted on the volumes.

For this, you will be having the master

and any replica encrypted using KMS.

And this is defined at launch time

during the first launch of your database.

If somehow you haven't encrypted the master database,

the main database,

then the read replicas cannot be encrypted.

Also, if you wanted to encrypt

an already existing unencrypted database,

what you would have to do is to take a database snapshot

from that un-encrypted database,

and then you restore that database snapshot

as an encrypted database. Okay?

So you have to go through a snapshot and restore operation.

So this is for at-rest encryption.

Then you have in-flight encryption.

So between your clients and your database.

So each database on RDS and Aurora

is ready to have in-flight encryption by default.

And so therefore, your clients must

use the TLS root certificates from AWS.

They're provided on the AWS website.

In terms of database authentication.

Because this is RDS and Aurora,

you can use the classic combo of username and password.

But because it says AWS,

you can also use IAM roles to connect to your database.

That means that's, for example,

if you're EC2 instances had IAM roles,

they can authenticate to your database directly using that

and not a username and a password,

which can help you manage all the security

within AWS and IAM.

You can also control network access to your database

using security groups.

So you can allow or block specific ports,

specific IP, specific security groups.

And then finally RDS and Aurora do not have SSH access,

of course, because they're managed services,

except if you use the RDS custom service from AWS.

And if you wanted Audit Logs.

So to know what queries are being made

on RDS and Aurora over time

and what's happening on databases,

you can enable Audit Logs.

And then they will be lost after a bit of time.

Therefore, if you wanted to keep them

for a long period of time,

what you need to do is to send them into a dedicated service

called the CloudWatch Logs service on AWS.

So that's it for the short lecture

on the summary options for security, for RDS and Aurora.

I hope you liked it.

And I will see you in the next lecture.
