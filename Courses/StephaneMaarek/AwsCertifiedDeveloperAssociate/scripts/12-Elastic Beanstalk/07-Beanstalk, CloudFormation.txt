Okay so let's have a look under the hood

at how Elastic Beanstalk works.

So under the hood, Beanstalk relies on something

called CloudFormation, and we'll see CloudFormation

in this course later on, but as a sneak peak,

CloudFormation is used to provision other AWS services

so we have our infrastructure as code.

So Elastic Beanstalk is using CloudFormation

as it's basis to do a lot of it's operations.

So why would I tell you this?

Well the use case is that using the CloudFormation resources

in your .ebextensions folder that we just saw before,

you can provision anything you want.

So you can provision an ElastiCache, an S3 bucket,

an DynamoDB table, whatever you want and that you'll

see in this course.

So the beautiful thing is that Elastic Beanstalk,

even though the UI only allows you to configurate

a few things, with EB extensions and CloudFormation,

you can configure anything you want in your AWS.

So let's have a sneak peek into it to see how

CloudFormation was used during this session.

So I'm here in Beanstalk and we have

our application with two environments.

So now I'm going to go to CloudFormation and show you

what happens behind the scene.

So in CloudFormation I can see I have two stacks,

don't worry about this one,

I have two stacks called eb-e stack and eb-e stacks

and so they are different.

So the first stack is actually, we can have a look here,

for -en and this one is for -prod.

So let's make it very simple let's look at the -en one.

So if I click on the stack, it corresponds to a

CloudFormation template and you can have a look

by clicking on template and this would show you

the entire template.

Now you don't need to know how to read this right now,

don't worry we'll learn about it later in this course.

But the cool thing is that if you go to resources

it shows you everything this CloudFormation stack

has created for us.

So as we can see, it has created an autoscaling group,

an autoscaling group launch configuration,

there was a Elastic IP, so EIP.

There was as well as EC2 security group,

and there was wait conditions

that we can simply ignore for now.

And then if I go to the other stack, so the -prod stack,

this time they created 16 resources.

So we have an autoscaling group,

a launch configuration, a scaling policy, right here,

another scaling policy, we can simply ignore this.

So CloudFormation, a CloudWatch alarms, another

CloudWatch alarm, this is used for the scaling policies.

And then EC2 security group, another security group.

And finally and elastic load balancer

alongside listener rules and a target group.

So CloudFormation was used behind the scenes

to provision our Elastic Beanstalks.

Now we don't need to touch anything in CloudFormation,

but just so you know using CloudFormation you could deploy

Elasticache, or DynamoDB, or S3 buckets.

And so that would allow us to expand our Elastic Beanstalk

applications to include anything we wanted.

That's it for this Halil review, I hoped you liked it,
