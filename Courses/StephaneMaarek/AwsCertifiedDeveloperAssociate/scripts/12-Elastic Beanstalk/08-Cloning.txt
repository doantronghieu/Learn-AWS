So here is a handy feature

of Elastic Beanstalk.

It is allowing you to clone an existing environment

into a new environment

and it will have the exact same configuration

which is extremely helpful

if you already have a production version of your application

and you want to deploy a test version

with the exact same settings,

then you would just do a cloning

between your prod environment and your new environment

for testing.

All the resources and the configuration

of the original environment are preserved.

So that includes the load balancer type

and the configuration, the RDS database type

although if you have an RDS database

the data is not going to be preserved,

but the configuration of your RDS database will,

environment variables and so on.

And after cloning an environment

you can change its settings.

So let's quickly go see in the console how this works.

So let's have a look at cloning.

So if I click on My Application dev,

Action and then Clone Environment

I have the option to clone it into a new environment.

For example, dev two or test or whatever you want.

And as you can see, the options are quite limited.

You can clone into a new platform version if you wanted to

or not even actually, and choose a service role.

And then you click on Clone and this will create

an entirely same environment hence cloning.

Of course, then once you have cloned an environment

you can customize its settings

thanks to the Configuration tab.

But I just went through the option,

and again, the goal of it is maybe to deploy a new version

to do some tests and then to perform

a swap of the environment to name.

Okay, that's it for this lecture.

I hope you liked it, and I will see you in the next lecture.
