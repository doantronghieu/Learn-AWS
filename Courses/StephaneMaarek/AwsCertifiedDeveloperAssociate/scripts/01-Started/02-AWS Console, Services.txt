So welcome to the AWS Console Home.

And in this page, you can do a lot of things.

So first of all, let's have a look

at the top right corner of your screen,

right now, this is what's called the regions selector,

and right now I am in Northern Virginia,

US east one.

But it is advised for this course to

choose a region that is geographically close to you.

So because I'm in Europe, I'm actually close to Ireland.

So I can choose EU west one.

But if you are in other regions of the world, for example

if you're in Africa and you're close to Capetown

then choose this.

Of course you don't have to physically be

in that region to use that region, okay?

You can for example

choose whatever region makes sense for you.

So choose whatever is closest

and this will give you the lowest amount of latency.

Next in the console console, you will see a list

of recently visited services

and it should be empty for you.

And I just tried that one

so it's showing one right here for me.

On the bottom you get some information about AWS.

You get the health issues, if need be

and cost and usage info for your accounts

as well as tutorials to build a solution and so on.

So this webpage is actually changing a lot over timeless

changed a lot for the past two years.

And so it may not look exactly the same as you

and in case it looks very, very, very different.

I will rerecord this lecture.

Okay, so once we have this

we need to look at services of AWS.

And for this two options,

the first one is to go on the top left click on services

and you can either look at services

by alphabetical order, as you can see

there are a lot of services on AWS,

or by category for example, for compute

you will have all these services and so on.

But don't worry over time,

we will learn these services

and we don't have to navigate that page.

Another thing I really like is the search bar.

So you can actually type a service for example, route 53

and then it gives you search results.

So it gives you four services that match this query, okay?

And then within these services,

we can also have a look at features

and 13 features match them.

So we can directly jump into the domain names

of the route 53 service and it's a good thing.

We can also look at blogs, knowledge articles

documentations and so on.

So this is quite cool.

Let's go into route 53 now to have a look at this console.

So this one is very special because

on the top right hand side, it says global.

That means that this console

does not require a region selection.

And that is more of the exception than the rule,

but some services in AWS are where

it's called global services and no matter where you are

you're going to get the same view.

But if you switch services and you go, for example

to the EC two service,

this time on the top right hand side,

as you can see it says Ireland

because I chose the Ireland region.

And so based if I run this console in Ireland

or say in another region, for example, in Canada,

well my view is going to be different

in terms of the resources that I will see.

So that's why it's important for you to remain

within the same region for the entire duration

of this tutorial and this course.

The other thing you can look at

is called the AWS global infrastructure

that you can find on Google.

And this gives you a lot

of information around your services.

And one thing that is very important to look at

is the AWS regional services.

And it gives you the services list by region.

And so this is table,

and so for example, if in the course,

I talk about a service and do a hands on,

but it doesn't seem to be in your region,

you can check here and find the availability of services.

So for example, we can check a look,

have a look for Cape town

and see the services that are available in this region.

And if you don't see a service

maybe you need to switch a region

in of course the console,

to have access to it

because not all the services from AWS are in every region.

So that's it for this lecture,

I hope you liked it

and I will see you in the next lecture.
