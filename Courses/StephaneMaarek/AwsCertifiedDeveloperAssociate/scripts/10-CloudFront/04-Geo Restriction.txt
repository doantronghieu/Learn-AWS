Just a short lecture

around CloudFront Geo Restriction.

So you can restrict who can access your distribution

based on the country where they try

to access the distribution from.

So you can set up an allowlist to define a list

of approved countries,

or you can set up a blocklist to set up a list

of banned countries.

Now the country is determined

by using a third-party Geo-IP database to match the IP

of the user to the country it belongs to.

So the use case for using geo restriction

would be copyright laws to control access to content.

So to turn on geographic restrictions,

go under Security,

and then under here

you will find CloudFront geographic restrictions,

and there is countries.

And then you click on Edit.

So it's a bit hidden,

but under there you can have an allowlist or a blocklist.

So we can set up, for example, an allowlist

and let's enumerate the countries

that will be always allowed,

and the rest will be blocked by CloudFront.

So here we're saying that India and United States

is allowed on our CloudFront distribution.

So if we're happy with this, we save the changes.

And as you can see, now the type of it is allowlist

and the countries are listed here.

And that's it.

So I hope you liked it,

and I will see you in the next lecture.
