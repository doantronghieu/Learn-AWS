So here is a short lecture

on real-time logs in CloudFront.

So it's possible for you to get all the requests

that are received by CloudFront to be sent in real time

to a Kinesis Data Stream.

The goal of this is, for example, to monitor, analyze,

and take actions based on content delivery performance.

So just to give you an overview,

the users are going to do a lot of requests into CloudFront

and then if you enable the real-time logs,

all these requests are going to be logged into

a Kinesis Data Stream.

And then, for example,

you can use a Lambda function to process these records

from your Kinesis Data Stream.

If you need to do near real-time processing,

you will do the exact same first part,

because CloudFront can only send to Kinesis Data Stream,

but then you would use Kinesis Data Firehose

to process these records by batches

and maybe send them into Amazon S3 or Open Search,

or whatever destination you may have in mind.

So this allows you to choose, as well, the sampling rate,

which is the percentage of the request you want to receive

in your Kinesis Data Stream.

Because if you have a very high traffic type of API

or endpoint, you may not want to have all requests in there,

just a sample.

And also, you can specify which fields

and which cache behaviors or path patterns

you want to have access to in your Kinesis Data Stream.

So for example, you say, "Hey, I only wanna have

(indistinct) slash images type of cache behavior,

because I just wanna see the request done

to this path specifically."

Okay, that's it for this lecture.

I hope you liked it and I will see you in the next lecture.
