So as you know, it's possible for CloudFront

to access any custom HTTP backend.

So this includes as well an EC2 instance

or an application load balancer.

So let's say we've developed an HTTP backend

on top of an EC2 instance

and so we want our users to access it through CloudFront.

How do we do?

Well, they will access the edge locations of CloudFront

and these edge locations will be making requests

into our EC2 instances.

And therefore the EC2 instances must be public,

otherwise the edge locations will not be able

to access our EC2 instances

because there's no private VPC connectivity

in CloudFront.

So therefore, we must also have a security group

that allows the list of all the public IP

of the edge locations of CloudFront

to make sure the security is compatible and works.

And you can find a list of these CloudFront IPs

in this URL right here.

So that's our first pattern.

The second pattern is to use an application load balancer.

So again, it must be public

and then the backend EC2 instances can be private

because there is private VPC connection

between the application load balancer and our EC2 instances.

We just need to make sure

that the EC2 instances security group

allows the security group of the load balancer.

So therefore, the users will be accessing the edge locations

and then the public IPs of the edge locations

must be allowed in the security group of the ALB

to make sure connectivity can be established.

Okay, so that's it for this lecture.

I hope you liked it and I will see you in the next lecture.
